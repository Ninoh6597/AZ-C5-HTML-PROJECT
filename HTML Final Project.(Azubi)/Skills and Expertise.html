    <section><h2>Expertise</h2>
        <P>Areas of expertise are sets of skills or talents that someone has, which they can list on their resume. These skills can
        increase a candidate's likelihood of being hired since the employer can see that they are an experienced professional with many abilities.</P>
        <ul>
            <li style="color: blue;">Network configuration</li>
            <p>If you know more than average about networks, you could become a network administrator. Administrators are responsible
            for setting up networks and administering them, which involves knowledge such as IP setup, wireless routers, cloud
            services and coding.</p>
            <li style="color: blue;">Hardware deployment</li>
            <p>Hardware deployment involves: packing, unpacking and setting up technical equipment.</p>
            <li style="color: blue;">Operating system knowledge</li>
            <p>Understanding how to work and fix various operating systems is an important IT skill. While an individual business may
            utilize only one operating system, having proficiency in multiple system software can increase your appeal to employers
            who may want to switch over to a new system in the future.</p>
            <li style="color: blue;">Database management</li>
            <p>A database is a program that stores and manages data. An IT job might include a need for data entry or database use, so
            it's important to know the basics. Database management requires detail and accuracy. It also normally requires the
            ability to read and use Standard Query Language (SQL).</p>
